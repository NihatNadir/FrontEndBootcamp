## Features
- Dynamic menu filtering by category (All, Korea, Japan, China)
- Interactive UI with hover effects on filter buttons
- Responsive design using Bootstrap for seamless user experience on various devices

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: The structure of the web page is defined in the `index.html` file.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for the menu and buttons are included in the `style.css` file.
- **JavaScript**: Menu data manipulation and interactivity are handled in the `app.js` file.

### External Libraries
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive design and predefined UI components.
- **Google Fonts**: Fonts "Great Vibes" and "Zilla Slab" are used for typography.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: Custom CSS file for styling the web page.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file for dynamic filtering and event handling.

## How It Works
1. The menu data is stored as an array of objects in `app.js`.
2. Filter buttons are dynamically created based on categories (All, Korea, Japan, China).
3. When a filter button is clicked, the menu is dynamically updated to show items from the selected category.
4. Hover effects are added to buttons for better interactivity.


## Usage
- Open the application in any modern web browser.
- Click on the filter buttons to view menu items by category.
- Hover over buttons to see the interactive effects.
